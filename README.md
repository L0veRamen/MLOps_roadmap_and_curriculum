# A guide and roadmap from beginner to advance for Machine Learning in Production / MLOps 

The question many ask is "How do I start". I am documenting my journey and creating a roadmap/curriculum that can be used as a guide to learn MLOps. Since I learn more by doing, this journey is project-based.

Building a machine learning model with high accuracy and performance is good but we need to move beyond that. To add more value to our machine learning model, we need to deploy the machine learning or deep learning model to production to solve real-life problems. Automating the process of deploying a model to production is sometimes known as MLOps. MLOps is an emerging and complex field because it requires a lot of components and skills. This repo makes the learning of MLOps easy.

## Lesson 1
### Introduction to Machine Learning Operations(MLOps)

- Meaning and Importances of MLOps
- Difference between MLOps and other Ops like DevOps, DataOps, DevSecOps?
- Building user interface and deploying Machine Model with Gradio and Streamlit
